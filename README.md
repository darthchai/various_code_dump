# various_code_dump

I wish I had done this sooner but better late...

dumping some of the utility codes I have written for myself to make my life easy. 
Mostly shell stuff cause I find that although the shell is limited in its' offerings, it can do a shit-load of work that is repetitive.

I will also dump some of my 3d printing designs here if I get the time.
